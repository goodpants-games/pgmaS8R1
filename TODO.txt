- two weapons:
    melee attack: long windup you need to time, but takes no battery
    gun: easier to use but takes battery
- maybe killing enemies give you battery, so you would have an actual reason
  to try to kill enemies. kind of.
- rooms generate in a 5x5 grid, each room being 32x32 tiles.
- there is a starter room placed on one side of the map, randomly selected.
  no enemies there.
- maybe the things you destroy are transcendental/eldritch Creatures you have to
  kill. maybe they're not aggressive. they're hiding so that's why you need to
  emit an electromagnetic to make them reveal themselves.
- please work on an actual enemy and gameplay stop working on the fucking
  graphics please.
