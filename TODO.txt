name: System Failure Imminent
      (then, this text should be spammed on death animation)
      (also when you manage to destroy all hearts, siren should play
       and a TTS saying this should play on "intercom")

- make tentacles of flying enemy death sprite a separate sprite that faces
  upwards, so it doesn't clip through the ground. although this does require
  a bit of a rework with the rendering system
- mabye optimize performance? (i think heart particles makes lag)
- TODO!!!!! add in-game tutorial
            also indicator for when you've already destroyed a heart in
            a room?
            Also camera shake i think. battery shake when decrease.

- three runs, three hearts per run, totaling 9 hearts
  all hearts are visible at start, and turn invisible on the next run once you
  visit that room. except one destroyable heart is guaranteed to be visible.
- you can "ping" (emit a electromagnetic pulse) in a room to reveal a heart.
  if there is no destroyable heart in that room, it deducts 30% of your battery
  (may need to adjust this number. also maybe it scales up on the third run.)
- the map will also indicate whether or not you already destroyed the heart in
  the room you are in.
- you get a letter grade at the end depending on how many hearts you've
  destroyed. (and/or maybe it's like a bad/good/best ending. would just be
  lore/text)

- two weapons:
    melee attack: long windup you need to time, but takes no battery
    gun: easier to use but takes battery
- maybe killing enemies give you battery, so you would have an actual reason
  to try to kill enemies. kind of.
- rooms generate in a 5x5 grid, each room being 32x32 tiles.
- there is a starter room placed on one side of the map, randomly selected.
  no enemies there.
- maybe the things you destroy are transcendental/eldritch Creatures you have to
  kill. maybe they're not aggressive. they're hiding so that's why you need to
  emit an electromagnetic to make them reveal themselves.

enemy ideas:
  - simple enemy that runs towards you
  - an enemy that charges up a dash towards you
    (or an enemy that flies and dive-attacks you, so you have to time to attack
     or you can just shoot them from mid-air. does mean i should make entities
     have drop shadows.)
  - weeping angel enemy that requires two gunshots to kill
    (but can be stunned temporarily by hitting it)
  - your past iterations somehow reanimated and out for blood !!>
