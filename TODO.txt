- make tentacles of flying enemy death sprite a separate sprite that faces
  upwards, so it doesn't clip through the ground. although this does require
  a bit of a rework with the rendering system

- two weapons:
    melee attack: long windup you need to time, but takes no battery
    gun: easier to use but takes battery
- maybe killing enemies give you battery, so you would have an actual reason
  to try to kill enemies. kind of.
- rooms generate in a 5x5 grid, each room being 32x32 tiles.
- there is a starter room placed on one side of the map, randomly selected.
  no enemies there.
- maybe the things you destroy are transcendental/eldritch Creatures you have to
  kill. maybe they're not aggressive. they're hiding so that's why you need to
  emit an electromagnetic to make them reveal themselves.

enemy ideas:
  - simple enemy that runs towards you
  - an enemy that charges up a dash towards you
    (or an enemy that flies and dive-attacks you, so you have to time to attack
     or you can just shoot them from mid-air. does mean i should make entities
     have drop shadows.)
  - weeping angel enemy that requires two gunshots to kill
    (but can be stunned temporarily by hitting it)
  - your past iterations somehow reanimated and out for blood !!>
