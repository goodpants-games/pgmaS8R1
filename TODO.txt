- two weapons:
    melee attack: long windup you need to time, but takes no battery
    gun: easier to use but takes battery
- maybe killing enemies give you battery, so you would have an actual reason
  to try to kill enemies. kind of.
- please work on an actual enemy and gameplay stop working on the fucking
  graphics please.
