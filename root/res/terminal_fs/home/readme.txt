Destroy the nine cores. They come in red, green, and blue. To destroy one it must match your color, shown in nanometers on your HUD. Your color changes on every cycle.

The cycle ends when you die. You have three cycles until the game is over.

IMPORTANT: You need to memorize the layout of the room you find cores, because they will hide on the next cycle, and rooms will rearrange.

Cores are visible the first time you enter a room, except for the spawn room. Upon visitation, they will hide on the next cycle. To reveal one in the room you are in, use your ping function (hold down the "Switch Weapon" key).

Rooms rearrange per cycle, but what rooms appear will not. Cores also stay in the same room layout throughout cycles.

For more information, use the "ls" command to list all the files in the directory. Use the "read" command to read files. You may also configure controls and other settings using the "pref" command.
