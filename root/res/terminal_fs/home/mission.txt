- Destroy the ten energy cores.
- You can only destroy the
  ones that match your resonant
  frequency (shown in nanometers).
- They will hide on the next cycle
  you see them. Use your ping
  function to reveal one in the
  room you are in. This will cost
  a significant amount of battery;
  use wisely. Rely on your memory.
- Rooms will be rearranged per
  cycle, but which rooms appear
  is constant. Cores will always
  appear in the same rooms.
