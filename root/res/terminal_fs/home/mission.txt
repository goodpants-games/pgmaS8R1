TL;DR:
- Destroy the nine Cores. They
  must match your color, shown
  in nanometers on your HUD.
- Sometimes they are hidden, so
  use your ping function (hold
  down the "Switch Weapon"
  key).
- Rooms rearrange per cycle.
  But Cores do not change which
  room they are in.
- All cores are visible on the
  first cycle.

You are one of three units deployed to deactivate the nine cores of this facility. Each room may hold a core.

You can only destroy cores that match your resonant frequency, and as an individual unit you cannot change this. Some cores may be hidden when you enter. Use your ping function (hold the C key) to emit a strong electromagnetic pulse that will reveal the heart in the room you are in, if it is present. Be wary that if the resonant frequency does not match, you will lose a significant amount of your limited battery; use this wisely.

It may be important to note that per cycle, the rooms of this part of the facility rearrange through unknown methods. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that after you shut down, we will be able to recover you. We can not recover your hard drive, and we do not know exactly what lays down there.
