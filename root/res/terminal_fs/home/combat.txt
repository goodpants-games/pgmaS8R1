== WEAPONS ==

MELEE (Metal Bar):
This weapon is harder to use than the laser gun, but it does not use any battery. It takes a relatively long time to swing it, and you are vulnerable to damage while doing so. Thus, you must be aware of your positioning, surroundings, and time your attacks properly while using it.

It typically takes three swings to kill things with it. It is advised to back off from the enemy you are trying to kill after you hit it, so that you have enough space to get another hit in before it is able to attack you.

RANGED (Laser Gun):
Your left arm has a laser gun attached to it. It is much easier to use than the metal bar, and can attack enemies from afar, but it costs 2% of your battery per shot. It is advised to not use this weapon frequently; only when you feel using the melee weapon instead is too risky.

It typically takes two shots to kill things with it.
